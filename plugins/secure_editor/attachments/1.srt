1
00:00:00,412 --> 00:00:03,112
I think it was the 27th of Shahrivar

2
00:00:03,112 --> 00:00:06,852
when the pager explosion incident happened.

3
00:00:06,852 --> 00:00:07,767
Were you in Beirut? Yes.

4
00:00:08,793 --> 00:00:10,483
What's your story from that day?

5
00:00:10,483 --> 00:00:13,113
I mean, what did you see?

6
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:18,503
Perhaps one of the most bitter memories, truly,

7
00:00:18,503 --> 00:00:21,553
etched in my mind, was the pager incident.

8
00:00:21,553 --> 00:00:25,973
Because that very day coincided with our last meeting

9
00:00:25,973 --> 00:00:28,883
with Seyed Hashem.

10
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:33,391
And quite coincidentally, we hadn't seen him for a long time.

11
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:37,881
Due to various incidents, it wasn't possible for him to travel.

12
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:43,011
The opportunity for us to gather as a family was very limited.

13
00:00:43,622 --> 00:00:46,282
And by chance, that day we were supposed to

14
00:00:46,282 --> 00:00:49,382
have a family lunch, all gathered together,

15
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:54,342
and he was also supposed to come for us to see him.

16
00:00:54,675 --> 00:00:58,165
Well, as I recall, it was exactly noon

17
00:00:58,165 --> 00:01:01,235
when the pager incident happened. Because we were all at the dining table

18
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:08,105
and had just laid out the food to start.

19
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:11,549
Suddenly, a very terrifying sound...

20
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,249
I mean, the sound was very loud,

21
00:01:14,249 --> 00:01:17,549
and at the same time, a strange smoke and dust

22
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,929
entered the house.

23
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:22,891
And well, we didn't know what it was, or what had happened.

24
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:27,511
At first, we thought maybe a gas canister or something had exploded downstairs.

25
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:31,911
Because in the hours prior, nothing specific had happened

26
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:35,511
to make us think that something might occur that day.

27
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:39,539
Then we saw, no, the noise in the street

28
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:42,509
started to grow, and people were shouting,

29
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,179
and there were some strange and unusual sounds.

30
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:49,949
We got a little worried and curious. After a few minutes,

31
00:01:49,949 --> 00:02:02,079
we realized that a number of pagers carried by our loved ones and the security team had exploded.

32
00:02:02,488 --> 00:02:05,258
So, your first encounter

33
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:08,128
was with the pager incident. Truly, I think

34
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,888
for up to an hour after the incident,

35
00:02:11,888 --> 00:02:14,148
no one had figured it out yet.

36
00:02:14,148 --> 00:02:19,108
I mean, they realized that many communication devices had exploded,

37
00:02:19,108 --> 00:02:22,508
but they didn't know they were all related just to the pagers.

38
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:25,328
They didn't know if it was just pagers in some cases

39
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:28,098
or if other devices were involved too.

40
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:30,958
And in those first moments, you probably thought it was just

41
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:34,358
something related to the security team. We thought that

42
00:02:34,358 --> 00:02:37,288
an assassination attempt

43
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:45,438
was about to happen. And, due to various scenarios, the security team's immediate assessment was that...

44
00:02:45,438 --> 00:02:57,418
they might have created a diversion to draw him out, and during the evacuation, while he was in the building, they would target the car.

45
00:02:57,868 --> 00:03:02,398
And, the scenarios that were really going through our minds at that moment,

46
00:03:02,398 --> 00:03:06,238
we truly didn't understand what had happened.

47
00:03:06,711 --> 00:03:09,321
Until some calls were made,

48
00:03:09,321 --> 00:03:12,181
and we were informed that a large number of pagers...

49
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:16,211
And when they saw what had exploded in the guards' room

50
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:20,011
and what had happened, they realized that

51
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:23,781
the pagers carried by the security teams had exploded.

52
00:03:24,028 --> 00:03:26,508
What was Seyed Hashem's own reaction in those moments?

53
00:03:26,857 --> 00:03:28,097
Very calm.

54
00:03:28,683 --> 00:03:31,613
I mean, when I say very calm,

55
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:36,413
truly, both in his expression, and I could tell

56
00:03:36,413 --> 00:03:45,183
from his demeanor, he was just a very calm and patient person by nature.

57
00:03:45,618 --> 00:03:49,768
And in that situation, our only concern was him.

58
00:03:49,768 --> 00:03:54,778
We didn't know the source of the incident or what was happening,

59
00:03:54,778 --> 00:03:57,008
and we were worried for his life.

60
00:03:57,008 --> 00:03:59,158
I kept insisting to him that,

61
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:00,818
'You shouldn't stay here.'

62
00:04:00,818 --> 00:04:05,538
Maybe another incident is about to happen, and it could be very dangerous for you to stay.

63
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,799
He kept squeezing my hand, saying,

64
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,259
'Be calm. We don't know what's happened yet,

65
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:15,009
and we need to decide with a clear head.

66
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:20,389
If we act out of worry and anxiety, we might make the wrong decision.'

67
00:04:20,866 --> 00:04:25,006
And I remember we had set the dinner table...

68
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:30,866
He looked at us... we hadn't even touched the food when it happened.

69
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:37,251
And he told us, 'Sit down, have a few bites of food until we see what's happened.'

70
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:41,893
But there was so much anxiety and stress

71
00:04:41,893 --> 00:04:44,533
that no one could even sit down.

72
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:47,383
He was mostly trying to calm us

73
00:04:47,383 --> 00:04:51,753
so that we could be calm, allowing them to make the right decision.
